# Final Project - Binary Converter

## Process Paragraph
Originally, I was going to make a river crossing game, similar to the one we
made in class. Obviously, it didn't work out, because this final project turned into something completely different. The river crossing game was a little too ambitious, to say the least. While planning I didn't realize that one; I wouldn't have enough time to build all the elements that were needed, and two; there were much more complicated evaluations that needed to be coded. On top of these, the river crossing game also required a "storyline" and graphics to go along with it (without these, the game wouldn't make much sense). I don't think I would have been able to create and plug-in all these graphics in time.

If I had more time, I would expand the converter, and "upgrade" the GUI. I could make a converter that goes from binary --> base 10, and I could even incorporate hex into the mix. I could "upgrade" the GUI, by making a dropdown menu where the user could choose which conversion they would want to make.
